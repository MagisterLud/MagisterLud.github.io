During the period 2016-2022 I tought students not only olympiad mathematics but we considered interesting non-trivial topics in such branches of Mathematics as Topology, Abstract Algebra, Differential Geometry, Probability in Combinatorics etc. In each case I tried to simplify a language and gave some intuitive of main ideas without loss of strictness as might as possible.

I thought 7 grade students. The discossed themes are close to the following ones: 

1. Graph Theory: property of trees, Euler's theorems on cycles in graphs, planar graphs, Euler's characteristic in 2-dimensional sphere case
2. Game Theory: numeral systems, Nim game, simmetry strategies
3. Number Theory: modular arithmetic, Euclid's algorithm, Fermat's little theorem, linear integral numbers equations
4. Geometry: convex polygons, Helley's theorem, geometric inequalities
5. Combinatorics: sets and operations over them, first simple observations about finite sets, binomial coefficients, binomial theorem

I thought 8 grade students. The discossed themes are close to the following ones: 

1. Graph Theory: mathings in graps, bipartite graph, Hall's marriage theorem, complete graphs, Turàn's theorem, Euler's characteristic in 2-dimensional sphere case, five color theorem 
2. Number Theory: Euler's function, Euler's theorem, Chinese remainder theorem
3. Geometry: areas of figures, similar triangles, circles and their proeprties, homothety, rotations, Euler's circle, Euler's line
4. Abstract Algebra: groups, first examples of groups, subgroups, Lagrange's theorem
5. Algebra: polynomes, little Bézout's theorem, Lagrange polynomial, Vieta's formulas for polynomials

I thought 9-11 grade students (common group). The discossed themes are close to the following ones: 

1. Plane geometry: inversion and its applications
2. Solid geometry: polyhedra, circumscribed and inscribed spheres
3. Spherical Geometry: lines, spherical triangles, law of cosines, law of sines
4. Hyperbolic Geometry: Poincaré disc model, Poincaré's half-plane model, Klein's disc model, hyperboloid model, isometries, cross-ratio, hyperbolic disstance, areas, hyperbolic law of cosines, hyperbolic law of sines, Thurstone's theorem, Mostow rigidity theorem
