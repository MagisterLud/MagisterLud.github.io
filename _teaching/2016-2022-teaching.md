During the period 2016-2022 I tought students not only olympiad mathematics but we considered interesting non-trivial topics in such branches of Mathematics as Topology, Abstract Algebra, Differential Geometry, Probability in Combinatorics etc. In each case I tried to simplify a language and gave some intuition of main ideas without loss of strictness as might as possible.
