During the period 2016-2022, I taught students not only olympiad mathematics but some interesting topics in Topology, Abstract Algebra, Differential Geometry, Probability in Combinatorics etc. In each case, I tried to simplify a language and gave some intuition of main ideas without loss of strictness as much as possible.
