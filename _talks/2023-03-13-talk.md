 In 1971, S. P. Novikov and V. M. Buchstaber gave the construction, predicted by characteristic classes. This construction describes a multiplication, with a product of any pair of elements being a non-ordered multiset of $n$ points. It led to the notion of $n$-valued groups. Soon after that, V. M. Buchstaber gave the axiomatic definition of $n$-valued groups, obtained the first results on their algebraic structure, and began to develop the theory. At present, a number of authors are developing $n$-valued (finite, discrete, topological or algebra geometric) group theory together with applications in various areas of Mathematics and Mathematical Physics. In this talk, we will give some key notions of $n$-valued group theory and discuss the authorâ€™s recently obtained results, which are related to multivalued discrete dynamical systems. We will describe some connections with famous results on symbolic dynamics, combinatorics on words and constructions of quasicrystals.
