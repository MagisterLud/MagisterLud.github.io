Welcome to my page! 

I am a PhD student and research assistant at [Steklov Mathematical Institute of RAS](https://www.mi-ras.ru/index.php?c=main&l=1) and research assistant at the [Lab of Algebraic Topology and its Applications at HSE University](https://cs.hse.ru/en/ata-lab/about).

I am working on homotopy theory, higher geometry, group theory and $K$-theory.

I am a co-host of the study seminar [Homotopy Theory & Applications](https://researchseminars.org/seminar/HomotopyTheoryAndApps).
