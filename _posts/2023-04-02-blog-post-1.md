[This image](https://github.com/MagisterLud/MagisterLud.github.io/blob/master/files/simc_youth_race/tree-eps-converted-to.jpg) describes a multiplication on the 2-valued group formed as cosets group from the free product 
<div class="math"> 
\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{Z}/3\ast\mathbb{Z}/3\cong \langle a, b \ | \ a^3 = b^3 = 1  
\rangle\end{equation*}
</div>
with respect to the cyclic automorphism $a\mapsto b$ of order 2. [See](https://magisterlud.github.io/talks/2023-03-13-talk) for details
