The Brieskorn spheres $\Sigma(p, q, r)$ are important examples of homology 3-dimensional spheres, i. e., manifolds with the homology being like one of a 3-dimensional sphere. They were extensively studied by Egbert Brieskorn and John Milnor. Henry Poincaré described the first one, $\Sigma(2, 3, 5)$ in his "Cinquiéme complément à l’Analysis situs" (1904). Now, the manifold $\Sigma(2, 3, 5)$ is known to be the *Poincaré sphere*.

> \Sigma(p, q, r) := \{ z\in\mathbb{C}^3 \ | \ z_1^p + z_2^q + z_3 ^r = 0\}\cap \{ z\in\mathbb{C}^3 \ | \ |z| = 1\}.

**Remark.** By analogy, one can define manifolds $\Sigma(a_1, ..., a_n)$ of higher dimensions. There are 28 well-known 7-dimensional exotic spheres (i. e., 27 of them have non-standard smooth structures) discovered by Milnor:
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma(2, 2, 2, 3, 6k-1), \ k=1, ..., 28
\end{equation*}
</div> 

It turns out that under some easy condition, manifolds $\Sigma(p, q, r)$ have
