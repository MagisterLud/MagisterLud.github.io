The Brieskorn spheres $\Sigma(p, q, r)$ are important examples of homology 3-dimensional spheres, i. e., manifolds with the homology being like one of a 3-dimensional sphere. They were extensively studied by Egbert Brieskorn and John Milnor. Henry Poincaré described the first one, $\Sigma(2, 3, 5)$ in his "Cinquiéme complément à l’Analysis situs" (1904). Now, the manifold $\Sigma(2, 3, 5)$ is known to be the *Poincaré sphere*.
