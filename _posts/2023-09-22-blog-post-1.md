The Brieskorn spheres $\Sigma(p, q, r)$ are important examples of homology 3-dimensional spheres, i. e., manifolds with the homology being like one of a 3-dimensional sphere. They were extensively studied by Egbert Brieskorn and John Milnor. Henry Poincaré described the first one, $\mathbb{S}^3 / 2I\cong \Sigma(2, 3, 5)$ in his "Cinquiéme complément à l’Analysis situs" (1904), where 
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
2I := \langle a, b \ | \ a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^5 \rangle\cong \mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z}/5)
\end{equation*}
</div> 
is the binary icosahedral group.
Now, the manifold $\mathbb{S}^3 / 2I$ is known to be the *Poincaré sphere*.

Recall the construction of Poicaré's sphere. We can look at $\mathbb{R}^4$ as the quaternion algebra $\mathbb{H}$. There is a 2-fold cover $p: \mathbb{S}^3\to \mathrm{SO}(3)$ sending each unit quaternion $q$ (i. e., a quaternion with the standard Euclidean norm 1) to the inner automorphism $\rho_q$ (i. e., $\rho_q(q_1) = qq_1q^{-1}$ for any quaternion $q_1$). The icosahedra rotations group $A_5$ sits inside $\mathrm{SO}(3)$. Consider its inverse image under $p$, then the corresponding quotient space $\mathbb{S}^3 / p^{-1}(A_5)$ will be the desired Poincaré sphere. 

> ### Definition
> A Brieskorn manifold $\Sigma(p, q, r)$, (with positive integers $p, q, r$) is a manifold 
> <div class="math">
> \begin{equation*}
> \Sigma(p, q, r) := \{ z\in\mathbb{C}^3 \ | \ z_1^p + z_2^q + z_3 ^r = 0\}\cap \{ z\in\mathbb{C}^3 \ | \ |z| = 1\}.

**Remark.** By analogy, one can define manifolds $\Sigma(a_1, ..., a_n)$ of higher dimensions. There are 28 well-known 7-dimensional exotic spheres (i. e., 27 of them have non-standard smooth structures) discovered by Milnor:
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma(2, 2, 2, 3, 6k-1), \ k=1, ..., 28
\end{equation*}
</div> 

It turns out that under some easy conditions, manifolds $\Sigma(p, q, r)$ happen to be homology spheres:

> ### Theorem
> A manifold $\Sigma(p, q, r)$ is a homology sphere if and only if $p, q$ and $r$ are pairwise coprime. If one of them equals 1, then $\Sigma(p, q, r)$ homeomorphic to the standard sphere $\mathbb{S}^3$.

**Sketch of proof.** The commutator subgroup of a group 
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\Gamma(p, q, r) := \langle x, y, z\ | \ x^p = y^q = z^r = xyz \rangle
\end{equation*}
</div>
acts freely on the universal covering space $\widetilde{\mathrm{Isom}^{+}}(P)$ of the plane $P$ isometries group $\mathrm{Isom}^{+}}(P)$. P denotes a plane with the constant curvature $K = \mathrm{sign}(1/p + 1/q + 1/r - 1)$. As it was shown by Milnor, the  resulting quotient space $\widetilde{\mathrm{Isom}^{+}}(P) / \Gamma'(p, q, r)$ is diffeomorphic to $\Sigma(p, q, r)$. Recall, if $K = 0, -1$ or $1$, then we will have $\widetilde{\mathrm{Isom}^{+}}(P)$ to be $\mathbb{S}^3$, $\widetilde{\mathrm{PSL}(2, \mathbb{R})}\cong \mathbb{R}^3$ or $\mathbb{R}^2\rtimes \mathrm{SO}(2)\cong\mathbb{R}^3$ respectively.

So, it suffices to prove $\Gamma'(p, q, r)$ being perfect (i. e., the first homology vanishes). It can be done by noticing that a manifold $\Sigma(p, q, r)$ is a Seifert fibration over $\mathbb{S}^3$ and it is obtained by some sequence of Dehn surgeries. Let $p, q$ and $r$ be denoted by $a_i$, $i=1, 2, 3$ for simplicity. A calculation of the fundamental group via the Seifert-Van Kampen theorem concludes 
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\Gamma'(a_1, a_2, a_3) = \langle x_1, x_2, x_3, h \ | \ \forall i [h, x_i] = 1, \ x_1x_2x_3 = 1, \ x_i^{a_i}h = 1\rangle
\end{equation*}    
</div>
Now, it is easy to see the desired property of $\Gamma(p, q, r)$.

<div style="text-align: right"> $\square$ </div>

The groups $\Gamma(p, q, r)$ from the proof have the following geometric interpretation. Consider the Coxeter group $\Delta(p, q, r)\subset \mathrm{Isom}(P)$ generated by side reflections of a triangle with angles $\pi/p, \pi/q$ and $\pi/r$ on the plane $P$ with a metric of a constant Gaussian curvature $K = 0, \pm 1$. The group $\Delta(p, q, r)$ contains a subgroup $\Delta^{+}(p, q, r)$ of proper isometries. On can show that the von Dyck group
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
D(p, q, r) = \langle x, y, z \ | \ x^p = y^q = z^r = xyz = 1 \rangle
\end{equation*}
</div> 
is isomorphic to $\Delta^{+}(p, q, r)$. 

There is the universal cover 
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\pi: \widetilde{\mathrm{Isom}^{+}}(P)\to \mathrm{Isom}^{+}(P)
\end{equation*}
</div> 
over the plane isometries group. Then, 
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\pi_1(\mathrm{Isom}^{+}(P))\cong \mathrm{Center}(\widetilde{\mathrm{Isom}^{+}}(P)) =: C
\end{equation*}
</div>
The inverse image 
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\pi^{-1}(\Delta^{+}(p, q, r))\cong \pi^{-1}(D(p, q, r))
\end{equation*}
</div>
is a central extension $\Gamma(p, q, r)$ of $D(p, q, r)$ by $C$
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
1\to C\to \Gamma(p, q, r)\to D(p, q, r)\to 1
\end{equation*}
</div>

As it was mentioned in the proof of the theorem above, Brieskorn's spheres are the quotient spaces: $\mathbb{S}^3 / \Gamma'(p, q, r)$ if the curvature of a triangle is positive, and $\mathbb{R}^3 / \Gamma'(p, q, r)$ otherwise.
